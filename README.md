# Smart_Energy_Meter
Author : Manthan Gujar

Welcome to the Smart Energy Meter project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a smart energy meter system that utilizes Arduino, ESP8266, ThingSpeak platform, ACS712 current sensor, ZMPT101B voltage sensor, and a LiquidCrystal LCD. The project aims to measure and monitor energy consumption in real-time, providing users with detailed insights through a cloud-based dashboard.

Features:
Real-time Energy Monitoring: Measure voltage, current, and power consumption in real-time.
Wireless Data Transmission: Send data to the cloud using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module.
Cloud Integration: Store and visualize data on the ThingSpeak platform.
Local Display: Display real-time measurements on a LiquidCrystal LCD.
Control Loads: Monitor and control a bulb to demonstrate energy usage.

Components:
Arduino: Microcontroller for data acquisition.
ESP8266: Wi-Fi module for wireless communication.
ThingSpeak: Cloud platform for data storage and visualization.
ACS712: Current sensor for measuring current.
ZMPT101B: Voltage sensor for measuring voltage.
LiquidCrystal LCD: Display module for showing real-time data.
Bulb: Demonstrative load to measure energy consumption.
